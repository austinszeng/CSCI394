# CSCI394
- Apparently I have to download clang and homebrew and an old version of C++ to get this assignment to compile
- need to test dump on all and write .slpy tests for all of them still
- test:
    - void IfSt::output(std::ostream& os, std::string indent) const {
    - and while
- test how this looks: 
    - void INot:output(std::ostream& os) const {

- for all of them:
    need to test --dump,
    write tests
    test running it
